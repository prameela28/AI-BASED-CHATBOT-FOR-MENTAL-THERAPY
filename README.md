     Abstract:

A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to that of a customer service executive. Chatbots are being widely used in customer interaction, and marketing on social network sites and e-commerce websites. AI-based chatbot has the core capabilities to learn from every question that initially relies on training through a pre-defined dataset. The web-based platform provides a vast intelligence that can help simulating problem-solving for humans. The involved technology here works based on Deep Learning, where NLTP for text processing and FLASK for web deployment are used. It enhances the accuracy and performance rate to higher inclinations considering its advancement. This chatbot is mainly developed to respond with textual commands using AI that appears to be real conversations. This proposed chatbot identifies the user context which triggers the particular intent for a response. Since it is regulated to dynamic responses, the desired answer will be generated for the user instantly. The prototyping model developed uses deep learning algorithms to train the Chatbot by experiencing various user responses and requests.
